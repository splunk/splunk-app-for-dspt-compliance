The average time to detect a cyber attack is over three months and it is not uncommon for incidents to take significantly longer to detect. The most important logs for identifying malicious activity should be held for six months as a minimum.

[Guidance from NCSC](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/security-operations-centre-soc-buyers-guide) on maintaining security of logs is available. 

Note: you are not expected to purchase a CSOC.",,"With regards to all logs being secured, Splunk Cloud, including data transit and associated storage uses industry standard SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security. For data transit, this is TLS 1.2+ encrypted and for storage at rest, AES 256-bit encryption. All forwarders and user sessions are also secured in this manner. Electronic messaging is secured by opportunistic TLS encryption on the email gateways. There are no plaintext connections.  In order to provide adequate security around who and how the data is accessible, Splunk fully supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for the user interface and API. RBAC can be used to control the segregation of duties and data (data sources, types, and time periods) and how they can view it (dashboards, reports, and views). Role-based access control (RBAC) provides flexible and effective tools that you can use to protect data on the Splunk platform.  Users are assigned to roles. A role contains a set of capabilities. Capabilities specify what actions are available to roles. For example, capabilities determine whether someone with a particular role is allowed to access certain data, add inputs or edit saved searches. There are predefined standard roles (User, Power, Admin) with a set of pre-defined capabilities. An admin can create custom roles that inherit from the built-in roles, and modify the custom roles as required.  In terms of data protection and the use of read only, as well as the AES encryption mentioned above, there are a number of other relevant futures. Encryption keys are rotated regularly and monitored continuously. Splunk manages the encryption key on behalf of customers. Splunk Cloud manages encryption by leveraging AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Encryption keys are regularly rotated and continuously monitored, this system is FIPs-140, PCI and HIPAA compliant. As well as these features around protecting the data through working copy, RBAC, encryption and OS permissions; Administrators also have an option to the protection into the platform itself by making indexes read-only so the index cannot be added to, but this would mean that new indexes are required for each time you wish to ingest data  Splunk Cloud generates Application Administrative Audit Activity Logs that includes add/delete/change to user management, system configuration etc.  Splunk auditing allows for distinct Splunk events to be logged to Splunks internal audit index. Every interaction with Splunk - search, configuration changes, etc - generates an audit event. Directories monitored by file change monitoring create audit events as well. On top of that, Splunk can cryptographically sign audit events. Audit event signing adds a sequential number (for detecting gaps in data to reveal tampering), and appends an encrypted hash signature to each audit event. If that is not sufficient, Splunk can be configured to verify the integrity of IT data as it is indexed. If IT data signing is enabled, Splunk creates a signature for blocks of data as it is indexed. Signatures allow you to detect gaps in data or tampered data. Splunk can also monitor, report and alert on privileged access for any monitored asset including Splunk itself  When it comes to data retention and lifecycle, Splunk Cloud provides daily backups (rolling 7 days) of configurations and data. These backups are scheduled on an hourly basis.  In addition to this, all data within the environment is replicated to ensure continuous data availability / resilience across indexers.  Once data is rolled from ""hot"" state, it then is written to S3 or GCS (Depending on which cloud provider is selected by the customer for the Splunk Cloud service). Both S3 and GCS provide 99.999999999% durability. When you send data to Splunk Cloud, it is stored in indexes and you can self-manage your Splunk Cloud indexes settings using the Indexes page in Splunk Web. Splunk Cloud retains data based on index settings that enable you to specify when data is to be deleted. To configure different data retention settings for different sources of data, store the data in separate indexes according to the desired retention policy. You can configure different data retention policies for individual indexes according to your auditing and compliance requirements.  Splunk Cloud default data retention configuration rolls data to frozen storage after 90 days. If a frozen storage path is not configured then that data is deleted. All disks are wiped and verified by Splunk before termination of instance. Termination process is attested within the Splunk Cloud SOC 2 audit report."
